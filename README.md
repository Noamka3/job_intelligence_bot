# Job Intelligence Bot

A personal job-monitoring system: syncs companies from a Google Sheet,
discovers new job postings on their career pages, matches them against a
CV and configurable target roles using hybrid (semantic + rule-based)
scoring, and notifies via WhatsApp. See `docs/architecture.md` for the
full design and `docs/job_sources.md` for verified ATS API formats.

**Status: Phase 1 (foundation) complete.** Schema, migrations, config,
logging, and a working `/health` endpoint. No ingestion, matching, or
notifications yet.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Docker Desktop
- A Google Cloud service account with Sheets API read access (Phase 3)
- An OpenAI API key (Phase 2+)
- A Twilio account with WhatsApp enabled (Phase 7)

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Create and activate a virtualenv, then install the project
uv venv --python 3.12 .venv          # or: python -m venv .venv
uv pip install -e ".[dev]" -p .venv/Scripts/python.exe   # or: pip install -e ".[dev]"

# 2. Copy env config
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with real values as later phases need them (OpenAI key,
# Twilio credentials, Google service account path, ...). The defaults are
# enough to run Phase 1.

# 3. Start Postgres + Redis
docker compose up -d postgres redis

# 4. Apply migrations
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m alembic upgrade head

# 5. Run the API
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
# -> GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/health should return {"status": "ok", ...}
```

### Note on ports

`docker-compose.yml` publishes Postgres on **5544** (not 5432) and Redis on
**6380** (not 6379). This is not the norm for a fresh machine — it's
because this particular dev machine already has a native Postgres service
and another project's containers on the standard ports. If you're setting
this up on a clean machine, feel free to change both back to the standard
ports in `docker-compose.yml` and `.env`.

### Note for editors/IDEs

Point your editor's Python interpreter at `.venv/Scripts/python.exe` (or
run `uv sync` equivalent) so import resolution and type checking work
in-editor, not just from the CLI.

## Running tests

Integration tests need Postgres/Redis running (`docker compose up -d
postgres redis`) — they exercise real constraints (unique indexes, FKs)
rather than mocking the database.

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest
```

## Code quality

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m ruff check .
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m mypy app
```

## Database migrations

```bash
# After changing a model in app/models/:
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe the change"
# Review the generated file in alembic/versions/ before applying -
# autogenerate does not know about the vector extension or intentional
# renames, and won't add `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector` itself.
.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m alembic upgrade head
```

## Troubleshooting

**`pip install` fails with `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`.** This machine's
antivirus (Avast) does TLS inspection with its own root certificate, which
the plain Python `certifi` bundle doesn't trust. Use `uv` instead of pip
(`uv pip install ...`) — it already respects the Windows system
certificate store (`UV_SYSTEM_CERTS=true` is set in this environment).

**`alembic upgrade head` fails with a password/auth error against
`localhost`.** Something else on the machine is already listening on the
port you think Postgres/Redis use. Check with (PowerShell):
`Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 5432` (or whichever port). This project
deliberately uses 5544/6380 for exactly this reason - see above.

**Celery on Windows (Phase 6+).** Celery's default worker pool doesn't
work on native Windows. The worker and beat scheduler are meant to run
inside Docker (Linux) containers, not directly on the Windows host -
Postgres and Redis already run this way, so this is consistent rather than
an extra step.

## CLI

Not created yet - the spec calls for a Typer CLI (`sync-sheet`,
`crawl-now`, etc.), but every one of those commands belongs to a phase
that hasn't been built yet, and an empty CLI with no working commands
wouldn't do anything. It's added in Phase 3 alongside the first real
command (`sync-sheet`).
